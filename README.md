Welcome to the official Random Profile Generator! Uses of this project include not wanting to share personal information on un trusted websites, or just to have fun looking at some silly names!
This project was created with a mix of Python, HTML and CSS. Although support may be dropped for this project later on, it probabaly wont. The Discord server will include information about the project and includes some FaQ's or you can ask support directly from the head developer of the project. D

To run this project, of course, just run the Main.py file. Also, don't worry if all of this is confusing, in v.3.1 there will be documentation! Not much at the start, but some will be added. Remember, if you want to use the web server option, be sure to follow the 'Flask' steps.

You can join the Discord server @ https://discord.gg/VxgNQACtrk.


Have fun generating!

   Install the following packages (Python & pip are required):
    If it prints "Requirement already satisfied: " you may just move on to the next package. In this example I'll be using pip, but if you have use pip3 or other package installers use those

    pip install PySimpleGUI
    pip install time
    pip install colorama
    pip install random
    pip install flask

## Flask  - Important for web server

This project uses Flask to run the Web Server option. To properly set it up, please do the following.

    $env:FLASK_APP = "main.py"

If that command doesn't work use this command:
   
    set FLASK_APP=main.py

Note, you can use: 

    python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
to check your flask version to make sure that it's up to date, it should be something around ``2.1.1``

If it throws any errors requesting the package to be installed, INSTALL IT
